<h2>APA Formatting and Style Guide </h2>
<p>These OWL resources will help you learn how to use the American Psychological Association (APA) citation and format style. APA style is most commonly used to cite sources within the social sciences. This resource, revised according to the 6th edition, second printing of the APA manual, offers examples for the general format of APA research papers, in-text citations, endnotes/footnotes, and the reference page. For more information, please consult the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, (6th ed., 2nd printing).</p>

<h3>Reference List: Basic Rules</h3>
<p>
Your reference list should appear at the end of your paper. It provides the information necessary for a reader to locate and retrieve any source you cite in the body of the paper. Each source you cite in the paper must appear in your reference list; likewise, each entry in the reference list must be cited in your text.</p>
<p>Your references should begin on a new page separate from the text of the essay; label this page "References" centered at the top of the page (do NOT bold, underline, or use quotation marks for the title). All text should be double-spaced just like the rest of your essay.
<p>Follow the Rules:</p>
<p>All lines after the first line of each entry in your reference list should be indented one-half inch from the left margin. This is called hanging indentation.</p>
<p>Authors' names are inverted (last name first); give the last name and initials for all authors of a particular work for up to and including seven authors. If the work has more than seven authors, list the first six authors and then use ellipses after the sixth author's name. After the ellipses, list the last author's name of the work.</p>
<p>Reference list entries should be alphabetized by the last name of the first author of each work.</p>
<p>For multiple articles by the same author, or authors listed in the same order, list the entries in chronological order, from earliest to most recent.
<p>Present the journal title in full.</p>
<p>Maintain the punctuation and capitalization that is used by the journal in its title.</p>
<p>When referring to books, chapters, articles, or webpages, capitalize only the first letter of the first word of a title and subtitle, the first word after a colon or a dash in the title, and proper nouns.</p>
<p>Italicize titles of longer works such as books and journals.</p>
<p>Do not italicize, underline, or put quotes around the titles of shorter works such as journal articles or essays in edited collections.</p>

<h3>Reference List: Articles in Periodicals</h3>
<p>APA style dictates that authors are named last name followed by initials; publication year goes between parentheses, followed by a period. The title of the article is in sentence-case, meaning only the first word and proper nouns in the title are capitalized. The periodical title is run in title case, and is followed by the volume number which, with the title, is also italicized. If a DOI has been assigned to the article that you are using, you should include this after the page numbers for the article. If no DOI has been assigned and you are accessing the periodical online, use the URL of the website from which you are retrieving the periodical.</p>
<p>Basic Form:</p>
<p>Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C. (Year). Title of article. Title of Periodical, volume number(issue number), pages. https://doi.org/xx.xxx/yyyy

<h3>Reference List: Print Sources</h3>
<h4>Basic Format for Books</h4> 
<p>Author, A. A. (Year of publication). Title of work: Capital letter also for subtitle. Location: Publisher.</p>
<h4>Work Discussed in a Secondary Source</h4> 
<p>Example: Coltheart, M., Curtis, B., Atkins, P., & Haller, M. (1993). Models of reading aloud: Dual-route and parallel-distributed-processing approaches. Psychological Review, 100, 589-608.
</p>
<h4>Dissertation, Published</h4> 
<p>Lastname, F. N. (Year). Title of dissertation (Doctoral dissertation). Retrieved from Name of database. (Accession or Order Number)</p>

<h3>Reference List: Electronic Sources</h3>
<h4>Webpage or Piece of Online Content</h4> 
<p>
Individual webpages and documents hosted online are cited similarly to print content. Note, however, that the URL is typically included at the end of the entry. The URL may, at the author's discretion, be left as an active link. Include additional information (like translators, editors, first edition publication date, and so on) as you would for print sources.</p>
<p>Author, A. A. & Author B. B. (Date of publication). Title of page [Format description when necessary]. Retrieved from https://www.someaddress.com/full/url/</p>
<p>If the page's author is not listed, start with the title instead. If the date of publication is not listed, use the abbreviation (n.d.).</p>
<p>You only need to include a date of access when the page's content is likely to change over time (like, for instance, if you're citing a wiki that is publicly edited).</p>

<h4>Article From an Online Periodical</h4> 
<p>
Online articles follow the same guidelines for printed articles. Include all information the online host makes available, including an issue number in parentheses.</p>
<p>Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Date of publication). Title of article. Title of Online Periodical, volume number(issue number if available). Retrieved from
https://www.someaddress.com/full/url/</p>

<p>If the page's author is not listed, start with the title instead. If the date of publication is not listed, use the abbreviation (n.d.).</p>
<p>You only need to include a date of access when the page's content is likely to change over time (like, for instance, if you're citing a wiki that is publicly edited).</p>

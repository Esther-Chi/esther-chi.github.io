<h2>MLA Formatting and Style Guide </h2>
<p>These OWL resources will help you learn how to use the Modern Language Association (MLA) citation and format style. MLA style is most commonly used to cite sources within the language arts, cultural studies, and other humanities. This resource, revised according to the 8th edition of the MLA manual, offers examples for the general format of MLA research papers, in-text citations, and the Works Cited page. For more information, please consult the official MLA Handbook (8th ed.).</p>

<h3>Creating a Works Cited list using the eighth edition</h3>
<p>
MLA is a style of documentation based on a general methodology that may be applied to many different types of writing. Since texts have become increasingly mobile, and the same document may often be found in several different sources, following a set of rigid rules no longer suffices.</p>
<p>Thus, the current system is based on a few guiding principles, rather than an extensive list of specific rules. While the handbook still describes how to cite sources, it is organized according to the process of documentation, rather than by the sources themselves. This gives writers a flexible method that is near-universally applicable. Once you are familiar with the method, you can use it to document any type of source, for any type of paper, in any field.</p>
<p>When deciding how to cite your source, start by consulting the list of core elements. These are the general pieces of information that MLA suggests including in each Works Cited entry. In your citation, the elements should be listed in the following order:
1.	Author.
2.	Title of source.
3.	Title of container,
4.	Other contributors,
5.	Version,
6.	Number,
7.	Publisher,
8.	Publication date,
9.	Location.</p>
<p>Each element should be followed by the punctuation mark shown here. Earlier editions of the handbook included the place of publication and required different punctuation (such as journal editions in parentheses and colons after issue numbers). In the current version, punctuation is simpler (only commas and periods separate the elements), and information about the source is kept to the basics.</p>

<h3>MLA Works Cited Page: Books</h3>
<p>When you are gathering book sources, be sure to make note of the following bibliographic items: the author name(s), other contributors such as translators or editors, the book’s title, editions of the book, the publication date, the publisher, and the pagination.
</p>
<p>
Below is the general format for any citation:
<p> Author. Title. Title of container (self contained if book), Other contributors (translators or editors), Version (edition), Number (vol. and/or no.), Publisher, Publication Date, Location (pages, paragraphs URL or DOI). 2nd container’s title, Other contributors, Version, Number, Publisher, Publication date, Location, Date of Access (if applicable).
</p>

<h3>MLA Works Cited Page: Periodicals</h3>
<p>Periodicals include magazines, newspapers, and scholarly journals. Works cited entries for periodical sources include three main elements—the author of the article, the title of the article, and information about the magazine, newspaper, or journal. MLA uses the generic term “container” to refer to any print or digital venue (a website or print journal, for example) in which an essay or article may be included.
</p>
<p>
Below is the "generic" citation for periodicals provided by the MLA. Use this as guidance if you are trying to cite a type of source not described on this page, omitting any information that does not apply:
</p>
<p>Author. Title. Title of container (self contained if book), Other contributors (translators or editors), Version (edition), Number (vol. and/or no.), Publisher, Publisher Date, Location (pp.). 2nd container’s title, Other contributors, Version, Number, Publisher, Pub date, Location.
</p>

<h3>MLA Works Cited: Electronic Sources</h3>
<p>Here are some common features you should try to find before citing electronic sources in MLA style. Not every Web page will provide all of the following information. However, collect as much of the following information as possible both for your citations and for your research notes:
</p>
<p>
•	Author and/or editor names (if available); last names first.</p>
<p>•	"Article name in quotation marks."</p>
<p>•	Title of the website, project, or book in italics.</p>
<p>•	Any version numbers available, including editions (ed.), revisions, posting dates, volumes (vol.), or issue numbers (no.).</p>
<p>•	Publisher information, including the publisher name and publishing date.</p>
<p>•	Take note of any page numbers (p. or pp.) or paragraph numbers (par. or pars.).</p>
<p>•	URL (without the https://) DOI or permalink.</p>
<p>•	Date you accessed the material (Date Accessed)—While not required, it is highly recommended, especially when dealing with pages that change frequently or do not have a visible copyright date.</p>
<p>•	Remember to cite containers after your regular citation. Examples of containers are collections of short stories or poems, a television series, or even a website. A container is anything that is a part of a larger body of works.</p>
<p>Author. Title. Title of container (self contained if book), Other contributors (translators or editors), Version (edition), Number (vol. and/or no.), Publisher, Publisher Date, Location (pp.). 2nd container’s title, Other contributors, Version, Number, Publisher, Pub date, Location.
